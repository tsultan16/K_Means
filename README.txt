Simple K-mean clustering algorithm implementation in python. Euclidean distance is used to compute proximity of points to centroids. Centroids are cmoputed using mean of cluster points (this minimizes the sum of squared errors, i.e. sum of L2 distanced between points in the cluster from the cluster centroid)
